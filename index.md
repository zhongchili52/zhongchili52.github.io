<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">About Me</h2>

I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Psychology at [University of Florida](https://psych.ufl.edu/social-psychology/people/) advised by [Dr. Gregory Webster](https://www.gdwebster.com/) and Minor in [Computer & Information Science & Engineering](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/) advised by [Dr. Emmanuel Dorley](https://www.emmanueldorley.com/#intro). I received my <font color="#fd5e53">M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering</font> at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/) where I also worked closely with [Dr. Brooke Feeney](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/relationships-lab/brooke-feeney-associate-professor.html) and [Dr. David Creswell](https://www.healthandhumanperformancelab.com/people). I received my <font color="#fd5e53">B.Eng. in Information Engineering</font> at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/) where I graduated from the [Chien-Shiung Wu Honored College](https://wjx.seu.edu.cn/wjxen/).

Nurtured by my interdisciplinary roots in engineering, computer science, psychology, and marketing, I study consumer psychology and human-centered artificial intelligence. Currently, I seek to understand the psychological factors and human-like decision making of large language models, and evaluate them from a consumer interaction perspective.
