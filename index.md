<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">About Me</h2>

I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Psychology at [University of Florida](https://psych.ufl.edu/social-psychology/people/) advised by [Dr. Gregory Webster](https://www.gdwebster.com/) and Minor in [Computer & Information Science & Engineering](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/) advised by [Dr. Emmanuel Dorley](https://www.emmanueldorley.com/#intro). I received my <font color="#fd5e53">M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering</font> at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/) where I also worked closely with [Dr. Brooke Feeney](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/relationships-lab/brooke-feeney-associate-professor.html) and [Dr. David Creswell](https://www.healthandhumanperformancelab.com/people). I received my <font color="#fd5e53">B.Eng. in Information Engineering</font> at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/) where I graduated from the [Chien-Shiung Wu Honored College](https://wjx.seu.edu.cn/wjxen/).

My research focuses on judgement and decision making and understanding the experiential value associated with consumer behavior and well-being. I am also interested in marketing strategies that foster consumer-brand relationships and brand loyalty in the context of the prevalence of social media and digital technology. I adopt interdisciplinary methodologies (e.g. statistics, computational neuroscience, engineering) and integrate novel techniques in machine learning (e.g. deep learning, NLP, LLMs) to better capture unstructured data and refine segmentation and prediction capabilities.

You can pronounce my first name like <em>Jong-Chr</em>. My name written in Chinese is 李仲篪.
