<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">About Me</h2>

I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Psychology at [University of Florida](https://psych.ufl.edu/social-psychology/people/) advised by [Prof. Gregory Webster](https://www.gdwebster.com/). I received my <font color="#fd5e53">M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering</font> at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/) where I also worked closely with [Prof. Brooke Feeney](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/relationships-lab/brooke-feeney-associate-professor.html) and [Prof. David Creswell](https://www.healthandhumanperformancelab.com/people). I received my <font color="#fd5e53">B.Eng. in Information Engineering</font> at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/) where I graduated from the [Chien-Shiung Wu Honored College](https://wjx.seu.edu.cn/wjxen/).

My research broadly centers around consumer behavior, judgement and decision making, and quantitative marketing. I am fascinated by integrating novel and advanced techniques in machine learning, statistical and computational modeling, and engineering to enhance detection and prediction accuracy and tackle the complexity and nonlinearity inherent in behavioral and psychological sciences.

You can pronounce my first name like <em>Jong-Chr</em>. My name written in Chinese is 李仲篪.
