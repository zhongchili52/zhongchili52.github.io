<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">About Me</h2>

I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Psychology at [University of Florida](https://psych.ufl.edu/social-psychology/people/) working with [Prof. Gregory Webster](https://www.gdwebster.com/). I received my <font color="#fd5e53">M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering</font> at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/) where I also worked closely with [Prof. Brooke Feeney](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/relationships-lab/brooke-feeney-associate-professor.html) and [Prof. David Creswell](https://www.healthandhumanperformancelab.com/people). I received my <font color="#fd5e53">B.Eng. in Information Engineering</font> at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/) where I graduated from the [Chien-Shiung Wu honors college](https://wjx.seu.edu.cn/wjxen/).

My research broadly centers around health disparities (e.g., sexual health inequities, minority stress, mental health disorders) among intersectional minority groups and ways to foster resilience. I am also fascinated by employing novel and advanced techniques in machine learning, data mining, computational modeling, and engineering to tackle the complexity and nonlinearity inherent in psychological and behavioral science. A significant portion of my work is dedicated to historically underrepresented and stigmatized populations, including LGBTQ+ individuals, single individuals, and racial/ethnic minorities. By shedding light on the unique challenges and resilience of these groups, I aim to contribute to a more inclusive and comprehensive understanding of health disparities and develop potential interventions.
