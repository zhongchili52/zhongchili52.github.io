<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">About Me</h2>

I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Psychology at [University of Florida](https://psych.ufl.edu/social-psychology/people/) advised by [Prof. Gregory Webster](https://www.gdwebster.com/). I received my <font color="#fd5e53">M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering</font> at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/) where I also worked closely with [Prof. Brooke Feeney](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/relationships-lab/brooke-feeney-associate-professor.html) and [Prof. David Creswell](https://www.healthandhumanperformancelab.com/people). I received my <font color="#fd5e53">B.Eng. in Information Engineering</font> at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/) where I graduated from the [Chien-Shiung Wu Honored College](https://wjx.seu.edu.cn/wjxen/).

My research broadly centers around decision making (e.g., customer decisions, risky decisions, misinformation) and intersectional health disparities (e.g., behavioral addictions, minority stress). I am also interested in the social and cognitive mechanisms underlying behaviors that have multifaceted influences on health and well-being. I am fascinated by employing novel and advanced techniques in machine learning, statistical and computational modeling, and engineering to enhance detection and prediction accuracy and tackle the complexity and nonlinearity inherent in psychological and behavioral sciences. A significant portion of my work is dedicated to historically underrepresented and stigmatized populations, including sexual and gender minorities, single individuals, and racial/ethnic minorities.

You can pronounce my first name like <em>Jong-Chr</em>. My name written in Chinese is 李仲篪.
